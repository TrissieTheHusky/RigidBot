			"Just started working on this bot quite a bit lately, and its been paying off. I've gotten quite a bit done, though the code is a bit messy at the moment. Will be cleaning it up for a while, now that the initial feature set is out of the way.",
			"Future updates will bring more great additions to the bot, including the exploration update that will be coming in its alpha state soon. That update will bring with it a working item system, spells, pets, events, and shops for both guilds and global use.",
			"It has been quite a fun time learning how to write discord bots, but ever since writing my first one, I've wanted to make a bot I could truly say is worth using. Already, this bot clearly has a lot to offer, albeit somewhat easily breakable. From moderation commands, utilities, and a few gimmicks it's off to a pretty good start. The economy is lackluster, but will continue to be grown constantly."
