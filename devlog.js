			"A good portion of the code has been rewritten or reorganized, which was a painful process, but definately worth it. It is not much easier to add content to the bot, and it won't break as easily. After finishing a few small features, it is safe to say that the first release version is now officially complete!",
			"There will inevitably be bugs, glitches, errors, and unexpected behavior. In fact, there are already some I have my eye on that need to be fixed, but it will take time to do so. If you find any problems with the bot, please let me know on the support server. This server can be found through the support command.",
			"Now is the time when I begin to move on to the second version, which will be in its alpha state. Labeled the exploration update, it won't dissapoint. A large collection of features will be implemented simply for fun. Games, economy, items, etc. It's going to be a blast to play, and to develop!"

			"Just started working on this bot quite a bit lately, and its been paying off. I've gotten quite a bit done, though the code is a bit messy at the moment. Will be cleaning it up for a while, now that the initial feature set is out of the way.",
			"Future updates will bring more great additions to the bot, including the exploration update that will be coming in its alpha state soon. That update will bring with it a working item system, spells, pets, events, and shops for both guilds and global use.",
			"It has been quite a fun time learning how to write discord bots, but ever since writing my first one, I've wanted to make a bot I could truly say is worth using. Already, this bot clearly has a lot to offer, albeit somewhat easily breakable. From moderation commands, utilities, and a few gimmicks it's off to a pretty good start. The economy is lackluster, but will continue to be grown constantly."
